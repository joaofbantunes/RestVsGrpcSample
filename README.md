# RestVsGrpcSample

Not at all serious comparison, just to see both in action and play around with them.

Current version running on .NET Core / ASP.NET Core 3.0.

Don't take the benchmark too seriously, I haven't invested much time in trying to make sure it's accurate. Feel free to open an issue or PR if you see something that could make it more accurate.

Quick note regarding `ComplexRest` benchmark: with the usage of the stream versions of deserialization, the benchmark results, particularly allocations, oscillate a fair bit, but didn't want to fallback to the string based approach as it's less optimized and I'm trying to keep the comparison as close as possible (but still remember this isn't the most thoroughly thought out benchmark ðŸ˜›).
